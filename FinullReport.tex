Over 10 years ago, I started out with no knowledge of what the hell a damn program was.
All I knew was that I was much like the thing I was fucking starting at.
I had an xbox 360 at the time, and the main video games were Halo and Call of duty at that time.
We played, and Video Games made me want to learn how to do all this shit.
I am sitting here in a virtual world, entirely different than the real world, probably better.
Well, guess I might as well learn how to write a code.
I opened up my xbox 360 did some quick fix soldering and hooked that bitch up to my computer.
Time to dump that shit. For fucks sake if i ever brick it, i better be able to rebuild it.
nandpro nand.bin: -r16 kv.bin 1 1
nandpro nand.bin: -r16 config.bin 3de 2
nandpro xbr.bin: -w16 kv.bin 1 1
nandpro xbr.bin: -w16 config.bin 3de 2
nandpro lpt: -w16 xbr.bin
Waiting for DHCP ......... FAIL!
starting httpd server .. OK!

Basically after a bunch of fun stuff. I haz homebrewz on sexBawx.
Now. Call of duty. Not necessarily interesting as MP game servers 
did not have active ban support. Occasionally if you fucked up enough, 
you would just overload the score buffer and it would reset into the negatives.
219746512738916 Was around the maximum score one could obtain in the game.
So if you capped over it, it would just reset you into the negatives, and a score
could become -219746512738916 and you would go from first to last in a ms.
More importantly. Halo was fun, because back in the olden days, Bungie had
and incredibly proactive ban hammer. The most obtainable piece of armor
was known as the Flaming Recon Helmet. Recon Helmets could only be obtained
from beating the game on the hardest difficulty, Obtain all hidden Skulls and collectables
as well as getting a certain score in a survival type game mode. Originally, there was only
one way to get a Recon Helmet. Impress the Devs so much that they basically suck your dick
and give you one, and that rarely happened. Only in community events with user levels in the millions.
So the udds of getting a Recon Helmet were slim, but with the new collectable system, I got it.
Now that isn't the interesting thing. Recon was available to the public after a certain time,
due to the Devs wanting to thank such a hardworking community. Flaming Recon Helmets were
reserves specifically for Devs. So... I got it.
Within each game, there is a certain attribute that determines the Armor Sets.
After the public addition to Recon Helmets, it was not much effort to spoof Devs.
Now, due to the proactive ban hammer deployed by the Devs. Hax || Modifications to this degree
would probably be sniffed out in around 7-10 hours. A short program giving _id to all devs
would mean that my _id was not in that program. Therefore I would get a ban, if they caught me.
Because Microsoft had a more advanced illegal hardware detector. The entire console would receive
a _id ban @ ~5 hours, depending on levels of modifications. 
So my console gets banned. GREAT. Dump the key vault storing console_id and information
then get a nubs. Thankfully, I had a few extra key vaults from all my Red Ringed xbox's.
Red Ring means BSOD. xDxDxDxDxD. Might be bricked, but it aint banned. So i gotz a bypass.
Anyway, long story short. I consider myself a hacker. Not by the fact that I want to collect data,
but because of the way I think, and my desire to learn as much as I can. 
Within my time at Butler University. I was severely unhappy. While I wanted to study computer science,
there was not a single person at this school that could point me where I wanted to study.
[YOU] make {ME} write {MY} version of [YOUR] game.
[WE] should [FIND] more [RESOURCES] so [WE] csprog [CAN] thrive [IN] no [TIME]
Upon graduation, I will be pursuing my true desires. The pursuit of cyber security.
I will be writing my own operating system and server to play games such as CTF
in an attempt to become a PenTester. I will thrive, in an environment that supports me
instead of an environment that attempts to destroy my creativity and despises me for my thought process.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. 
My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think. 
Not what they look like.
